# TINF21C-AAS-Server-Webclient
The "AAS-Server-Webclient" is a project of students of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University Stuttgart, which is carried out during third and fourth semester withhin the course of the lecture "Software Engineering".

# Goals
Asset administration shells are a concept of the industry 4.0 to standardize the digital representation of different physical products (asset). The asset administration shells provides all relevant information about an asset and gives the opportunity to reach its digital twin.
Most asset administration shells nowadays are technically orientated.
We want to change this and create the frontend of an asset administartion shell with significantly improved usability.
